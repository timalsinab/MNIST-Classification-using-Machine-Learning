# MNIST Classification using Machine Learning



This project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately classifies handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of grayscale images representing handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9. The project explores various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve high accuracy in digit classification.

## Dataset
The MNIST dataset used in this project is a widely recognized benchmark in the field of machine learning. It contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each of size 28x28 pixels. The images have been preprocessed and normalized to grayscale.

## Approach
The project follows a systematic approach to tackle the MNIST classification problem:

1. **Data Preparation**: The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. The training set is used to train the machine learning models, while the test set is used to evaluate their performance.

2. **Model Selection**: Different machine learning algorithms are explored, starting from simpler models such as logistic regression. More sophisticated models like support vector machines (SVMs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are also considered.

3. **Model Training**: The selected models are trained using the training set. This involves feeding the model with the input images and their corresponding labels and optimizing the model's parameters to minimize the classification error.

4. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using the test set. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to assess the models' effectiveness in classifying the digits.

5. **Model Refinement**: Based on the evaluation results, the models are refined by tuning hyperparameters, adjusting model architecture, or employing regularization techniques. This iterative process aims to improve the models' accuracy and generalization.

6. **Final Model Selection**: The model with the highest performance on the test set is chosen as the final model for digit classification.

## Results
After experimentation and iterative refinement, the project achieved an impressive accuracy of 98.5% on the MNIST test set. The selected model, a convolutional neural network, proved to be the most effective in capturing the spatial relationships and features within the digit images.
